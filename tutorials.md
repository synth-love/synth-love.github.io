When I first got interested in LV2, the learning experience was a lot of reading the standard and looking through reference documentation, sometimes looking at other plugins on GitHub. I would definitely love to put a simple example-driven tutorial series here that showcases all the information I wish I had when starting out to ease the process of getting into developing with the LV2 standard.
