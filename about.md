# Introduction

Greetings, everyone. My name is Jordan Halase. I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Japanese language. I also have an interest in [DSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing) programming and computer music, so naturally, I would be the kind of person to write digital synthesizers.

I like to work with [audio plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_plug-in) when I program. The architecture I choose for this is [LV2](http://www.lv2plug.in/) because of how clean and easily extensible it is, along with it being [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

# Mission Statement

The primary focus is to write audio plugins for musicians that are as computationally efficient as practical while also maintaining high quality sound and being feature-complete without unnecessary bloat.
