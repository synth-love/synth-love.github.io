# Introduction

Greetings. I am Jordan Halase, an undergraduate student majoring in computer engineering and minoring in Japanese language. This site focuses on [DSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing) and computer music. Perhaps some other things will be mixed in as well.

The chosen plugin architecture for real-time programming is [LV2](http://www.lv2plug.in/). It is [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and easily extensible to suit any real-time need.

# Mission Statement

The primary focus is to write real-time plugins that are as computationally efficient as practical while also maintaining high quality and feature-completeness without unnecessary bloat.
