Greetings, everyone. My name is Jordan Halase. I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Japanese language. I also have an interest in DSP programming and computer music, so naturally, I would be the kind of person to write digital synthesizers.

I like to work with [audio plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_plug-in) when I program. The architecture I chose for this is [LV2](http://www.lv2plug.in/) because of how clean and extensible it is, along with it being [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).
